1. To create the project I started with the command;
   $ lein new compojure hello-world
Note: I am using Clojure 1.5.1 and Lein 2.3.3

2. To run the default application created by this process run the command:
  $ lein ring server

3. To create a WAR and UBERWAR archive, I had to manually add the following
   dependencies to the project.clj file:

   [hiccup "1.0.2"]
   [javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5"]

4. By default static resources are served from "/", hence the references
   to css file in the generated code needed to be modified to remove
   nested path. For example, the generated views.clj code had a reference
   to include-css of "public/css/style.css". I had to change this to
  "style.css".
