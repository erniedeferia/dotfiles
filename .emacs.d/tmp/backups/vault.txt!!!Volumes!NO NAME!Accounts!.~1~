Notes
GITLAB:

Projects are prefixed with person that created them; you can transfer “namespaces” but that will cause confusion with having to change all of the server’s git repo’s as well. It’s better to keep my github account and just stick with it until you can find someone who can migrate the repo.

SERVERS:

You can find a list of the servers that are currently running by logging into digital ocean via the credentials listed above.
If you wish to reset the password on a server and/or gain access to the server, you’ll need to reset the root password through digital ocean.

TRANSITIONING PROCESS

In order to transition from the old code to the new code, you’ll need to:
Finish writing the permissions module and integrate it into each necessary route
Get the new code fully tested and signed off by Lynn
Move the documents in the existing amazon s3 folder to the new amazon s3 folder and match the current structure (found in the new code).
Reroute the DNS from the pleadingsvault.com server to the legaldocvault.com server
Voila!
