* Summary

When users signup a customer is created on Braintree. No subscription is added at this point.
Five days prior to the expiration of the Trial Period we send an email to the subscriber
informing them of the impending end of the trial and how to provide payment information.

If the subscriber decides to initiate a paid subscription the provided credit card is
stored on Braintree and tag their account with the credit-card-token. A daily tasks
is then responsible to detect the user as a valid paid subscriber and it submits a
transaction to Braintree to subscribe the user to the appropriate plan (without a Trial
Period). This initiates the payment cycle until/if the user cancels service.

The Braintree Service will email the user a receipt every month when payment is accepted
via the credit card the provided.

The user can change the credit card at any time. When that happens we always make the
new card the 'default'.  The user can also delete prior credit cards, but not the
default, which we remove when the customer is deleted upon cancelation of service.

* Detail Description

** Configuration on Braintree

URL: braintreepayments.com

On Braintree we define one or more subscription plans. A subscription plan includes
the cycle, price, and duration of a trial period. In our case, we will manage trail
periods time outside Braintree; hence, all plans defined on Braintree will have NO
trail period.

On Settings | Processing | Email Receipts we configure to send an email receipt by
default. Notice that this requires an SPF record to be added to the domain record
on the IPS which hosts the domain on behalf of which emails will be sent.
