(defn expected-returns-simple
  "Returns a very simple measure of expected returns, just the
   historical average. The month over month return is defined as
   (p1 - p0)/p1 or p1/p2 - 1. The partition form takes two elements
   from the sequence in steps of 1, this gives us the moving window
   needed to compute the month over month retruns."
